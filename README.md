## Why Hapdoc? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- `Easy to use`: Hapdoc is designed to be simple and user-friendly, making it easy for programmers to create documentation without having to spend a lot of time learning how to use it.
- `Markdown support`: Hapdoc supports Markdown syntax, which is a popular markup language used by many developers. This means that programmers can write documentation using the same tools they use to write code, making the process more familiar and efficient.
- `Customizable themes`: Hapdoc supports different themes, allowing programmers to choose a look and feel that matches their project or organization's branding. Additionally, programmers can create their own themes if they want to customize the look of their documentation further.
